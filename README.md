## Introduction

This git repository contains the lab exercises to the ULL Exoplanetas y Exobiologia course
2022-2023. The exercises will teach you the basics of how to 

- estimate the orbital period of an exoplanet together with its minimum planetary from a radial 
  velocity signal,
- estimate the exoplanet's radius and orbital properties from a transit light curve.

The exercises will also introduce you to some of the common tools used in astronomy and 
astrophysics, such as [git](https://git-scm.com), [Python](https://www.python.org/), 
and [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).

## Prerequisites

You'll need to install PyTransit 

    pip install pytransit 

And you may still need to install some additional packages required by PyTransit.

## Setting up Git

First, you'll need to create a GitHub account (if you don't have one already) and email it to me  so that I can
add you to the repo as a collaborator. Next, you'll need to clone the lab exercise repository from GitHub

    git clone https://github.com/hpparvi/ull_exoexo_2023.git

## Exercises

The exercises have been organised into two Jupyter notebooks. You'll need to start a Jupyter notebook
server from the directory you cloned the repo into

    cd ull_exoexo_2023
    jupyter notebook

After which you can open, edit, and run the notebooks.

## Returning the exercises

### Option 1

Send me your filled exercise notebooks as email attachments.

### Option 2 (advanced, bonus)

Fork the repository in GitHub instead of cloning it, clone the forked repository to your local computer, push the edited notebooks to your own fork in GitHub, and write me when you're finished.
